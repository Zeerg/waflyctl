## Description

The Fastly_Cdn module relies on Magento2's page cache functionality and extends
its Varnish capabilities to leverage Fastly's enhanced caching technology and
Geo-IP support.

The second component, the VCL, configures Fastly's Varnish to process the
client requests and Magento's HTML responses according to the Cache-Control
headers the Fastly_Cdn module adds to every response.
